What is the Blueprint Protocol? 

The power laws of longevity science. The 20% of the effort that accounts for 80% of the benefits. 
It consists of evidence based longevity protocols for diet, exercise, sleep, skin care, and more. 
We spent years compiling the evidence and developing the protocol on me. 
We measured the biological age of my 70+ organs and then implemented the protocols to see the effects. We repeated that process again, and again, and again until I became the most measured person in history. 
It’s exactly what I do every day and earned me biomarkers that rank among best in the world. 
What’s Different About Your Protocol?

We reviewed all longevity science and ranked the most powerful.  
We then did baseline biological age measurements of my organs. 
We implemented the science in me.
We measured my organs again, and again, and again until I became the most measured person in history.
We achieved top 1% optimal results in my comprehensive health markers.
We made all of this information free for everyone.


Why Did You Create the Protocol?

To ask the unthinkable question, is death no longer inevitable? 
To fix my own health problems
To provide a guide for everyone else to follow because everyone in health disagrees with everyone about everything making it hard to know what to do.
I decided to try and do something that the 25th century would respect (read more).
Death is our only foe.

Considerations for premenopausal women: During the follicular phase, women should focus on higher carbohydrate intake due to improved insulin sensitivity, while maintaining moderate protein levels to support muscle growth. In the luteal phase, as insulin sensitivity decreases, reduce carbohydrate intake and increase protein and healthy fats to support muscle maintenance and counteract the catabolic effects of progesterone.

Supplements: Luteal phase: magnesium, Ashwagandha, Rhodiola Rosea, sodium, potassium can help reduce stress, balancing hormones, reduce PMS-related fatigue, and combat water retention and bloating.

Considerations for postmenopausal women: Increasing protein intake is crucial to support muscle mass and counteract the effects of declining estrogen, which can lead to muscle loss. Calcium and vitamin D intake should be prioritized to help maintain bone density and reduce the risk of osteoporosis, as well as healthy fats to support cardiovascular health.

Supplements: calcium (1000-1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (2000 IU/day)
`

const Exercise = `
Exercise 6 hours a week. 

3 days of strength training 
3 days of cardio 
Aim for 150 minutes of moderate activity during which you can maintain a conversation. 
And 75 minutes of vigorous exercise where you’re unable to converse
Include flexibility, balance and mobility exercises. 
A workout protocol guide can be found here.


A few important tips: 


1. Avoid injury. Injuries can create serious limitations, create body imbalances and cause long term complications. It’s worth being cautious even if it means not doing certain things. 

2. Create an exercise habit. Do it everyday, no matter what (unless you’re injured, have a limiting medical condition, or under doctor's orders). You don’t even think about it. It just happens out of habit. Do not give yourself the option to decide. 

3. Work on strength training, cardio, balance and flexibility. 

4. Move throughout the day - after each meal, be active for 5-10 minutes. Every 30 minutes, get up from your desk and move around a bit.

5. Don’t get caught up and paralyzed in all the nuances and rabbit holes of exercise. Being active, in whatever ways you can, pays big for your health. 

6. Considerations for premenopausal females: Women should prioritize high-intensity and strength training during the follicular phase (first half of the cycle), as estrogen enhances performance, muscle growth, and recovery. In the luteal phase (second half), focus on lower-intensity activities like Zone 2 cardio and lighter strength training, as higher progesterone reduces exercise capacity and slows recovery.

7. Considerations for postmenopausal women: Prioritize strength training and HIIT to help maintain muscle mass, improve insulin sensitivity, and protect bone density. Weight-bearing exercises are essential for reducing the risk of osteoporosis and maintaining overall functional strength as estrogen levels decline.

The scientific evidence behind exercise is compelling, plus it makes you feel great. Regular physical activity is extremely important for increasing life expectancy and overall health.

Regular physical activity can reduce the risk of all-cause mortality by 26%-31% and cardiovascular disease by 28%-38%. (link)
Muscle Strength Predicts Longevity: A study (Warbutron, et.al., 2006) of over 1 million men found that low muscular strength in adolescence was associated with up to a 35% increased risk of dying young. 
Every pound of muscle burns 3x more calories than a pound of fat (6 versus 2) (Zurlo et al., 1990) 
Working out 2-4 times beyond the minimum recommended amount of vigorous physical activity (150-299 minutes per week) is associated with a 21%-23% lower risk of all cause mortality (link)
Combining moderate and vigorous physical activity can provide nearly the maximum mortality reduction of 35-42% (link)
Even small amounts of intense intermittent lifestyle physical activity (such as brief bursts of very fast walking or stair climbing for 1-2 minutes) are associated with lower cancer risk
`

const Sleep = `
High-quality sleep changed my life. It took me years to build the habits and systems that led to eight months of 100% perfect sleep. As far as I know, this is the best in the world. I’m going to teach you the habits for excellent sleep. 

We all know the energizing feeling of a great night’s sleep. It rejuvenates the body, boosts brain function, powers the immune system, and regulates hormones. It’s the foundation for well-being and longevity. 

On the other hand, sleep deprivation impairs. 

Being constantly awake for 18 or 24 hours is equivalent to having a blood alcohol content of 0.05% or 0.1%, respectively. In the U.S. 0.08% is considered legally intoxicated. 
Get six hours of sleep or less on average and you’re 4.2x times more likely to develop the common cold. 
A study in young healthy participants showed a 20% increase in S100-B levels following a single night of sleep deprivation, the same following a traumatic brain injury. 
One night with 4 hours of sleep showed a 70% reduction in the activity of natural killer cells in 18 out of 23 participants. One night of subsequent normal sleep was enough to restore NK activity to its baseline. Natural killer cells are what’s killing cancer cells among other functions. Preclinical studies have established a causal link between the lack of sleep inhibition of immune surveillance and increased tumor growth in animal models. 
Sleep deprivation diminishes cognitive functions, slows reflexes, and gives rise to poor decision-making. It’s linked to heart disease, diabetes, obesity, anxiety, depression and weakened immunity. 

If you only do one thing for your health: sleep. 

Master 10 habits.

Reframe Your Identity: You are a professional sleeper. Make sleep your #1 priority. Nothing influences your conscious and unconscious existence more. Plan your day around sleep. It’s the most important appointment in your calendar. Sleep will make you a top performer.
Create a 30-60 minute Wind-Down Routine: Set a specific time each evening to start winding down, for example: reading, taking a warm bath, breathing exercises, soothing music. Focus on transitioning your work and worry brain to sleep mode. 
Get Morning Light: Get outside within the first 15-30 minutes of waking to set your circadian rhythm and boost mood or use a light therapy device if natural sunlight isn’t available.
Regulate Evening Light: Dim the lights one to two hours before bedtime to create a relaxed atmosphere. Use warm (red is best) lighting in the evening. Install blue light filters on your devices (i.e. f.lux) and consider blue light-blocking glasses. Limit screen time at least an hour before bed and blackout your bedroom.
Regulate Your Bedroom Temperature: Keep your bedroom temperature between 60-67°F (15-19°C). Choose breathable bedding and light sleepwear. Use fans or cooling devices and consider taking a warm bath before bed. Ventilate your room and or use a temperature-controlled mattress if possible.
Keep a Consistent Bedtime: Choose a bedtime that allows for 7-9 hours in bed each night. Avoid scheduling late nights and be consistent even on weekends. Set an alarm for winding down. Track your sleep patterns with a journal or sleep tracker.
Curate Your Sleep Environment: Ensure your bedroom is quiet, dark, and cool. Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows. I have a copper pillowcase. Remove distractions and keep your bedroom clean and clutter-free. Consider using a noise machine to offset environmental sounds or earplugs if necessary. Buy a temperature controlled mattress if you can. (Code: “BLUEPRINT” for $100 off)
Eat your final meal of the day hours before bed: Try to have your last meal of the day at least two hours (experiment with 4 and 6 hours before) before bed and avoid large meals close to bedtime. Eating close to bed creates large metabolic demands on your body, causes blood glucose fluctuations, reduces melatonin production, and disrupts your body’s natural process of lowering core body temperature.
Avoid Stimulants Before Bed: Try to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and other stimulants at least 10 hours before sleep. Caffeine has a half life of 6 hours in the blood. That means that consuming a cup of coffee 6 hours before bedtime is equivalent to drinking half a cup immediately before going to bed! Opt for herbal teas or other relaxing drinks in the evening.
Gather Data: Track your sleep habits and patterns with a journal or sleep tracker. Use the data to make informed decisions and adjustments to your routine. Continuously monitor and tweak your habits to optimize your sleep quality.

const Females = `
FOLLICULAR PHASE: 

This phase is distinguished by the growth and maturation of ovarian follicles containing eggs, starting with the first day of menstruation and ending with ovulation. During the follicular phase estrogen starts off low and slowly increases leading up to ovulation. Progesterone remains low throughout this phase. 

These hormonal changes lead to:

An increase in estrogen levels causes increased insulin sensitivity (i.e., improves carbohydrate metabolism).
Improved muscle synthesis: Estrogen promotes muscle recovery and growth.
Lower core body temperature: Low progesterone levels lead to a lower core temperature, improving performance during high-intensity sessions.
Faster recovery: Higher estrogen levels contribute to improved recovery.

Protocol: Day 1 to ovulation (day 1 of menses to ovulation)

Training: 

Prioritize high intensity workouts and strength training during this phase. 
Recovery is faster, train more often.
Nutrition: 

Eat higher carb during this phase as insulin sensitivity is improved. 
Protein intake at 1.5 g per body weight in kg per day. 
Supplements: 

Standard Blueprint stack
Calcium 1200 mg daily

LUTEAL PHASE: During the luteal phase, progesterone rises, peaking after ovulation and remaining high until menstruation. Estrogen also rises but decreases before menstruation.

Increased core temperature: High progesterone elevates core temperature, reducing performance and slowing recovery.
Insulin resistance: Progesterone decreases insulin sensitivity.
Catabolism: Progesterone promotes muscle breakdown, requiring a higher protein intake and slowing recovery.
Water retention: Progesterone increases water retention.
Neurotransmitter changes: Progesterone can affect neurotransmitters like serotonin, leading to fatigue, irritability, and PMS.

Protocol: Post ovulation to menstruation

Training: 

Prioritize zone 2 cardio and easier strength training. 
Recovery is slower, lower intensity and regularity of activities.
Nutrition:

Increase protein and healthy fats. Reduce carbohydrates as insulin sensitivity is reduced. 
Protein intake at 2.0 g per body weight in kg per day. 
Increase anti-inflammatory foods. 
Combat water retention with adequate electrolytes. 
Supplements:

Increase Sodium 200-400 mg daily
Increase Potassium 200-400 mg daily
Increase Magnesium 100-200 mg daily
Ashwagandha 300-600 mg and Rhodiola Rosea 200-400 mg daily to help regulate stress, reduce bloating, and alleviate PMS symptoms during early and later luteal phase.
Melatonin 1-3 mg nightly to help improve sleep quality and reduce inflammation. 

Late Luteal Phase: Last week to a few days before menses. 

Training:

Light training only. Self care activities. 
Nutrition:

Anti-inflammatory foods and continued hydration.

How do you identify ovulation: 

Monitor your basal body temperature: Many wearables now track basal temperature during sleep or upon waking. Look for a 0.5 to 1.0-degree increase, which begins 1-2 days after ovulation and often persists until menstruation.
Cervical mucus changes: You'll notice increased production and a change in consistency—clear, slippery, and stretchy, similar to egg whites.

PERIMENOPAUSE AND MENOPAUSE:

Training: 

Focus on strength training and HIIT to maintain muscle mass and prevent insulin resistance.
Weight-bearing activities and high-intensity exercise are critical for protecting both bone and muscle mass.
Nutrition:

Increase protein intake to support muscle mass.
Aim for 2.0 g/kg of protein per day.
Supplements:

Continue with the regular Blueprint stack.
Use Ashwagandha and Rhodiola as needed for stress and mood management.
Magnesium: 100-200 mg daily, as needed for mood.
Calcium: 1200 mg daily.

const BadHabits = `
Years ago I could not stop myself from overeating everyday at 7 pm. One day out of desperation, I said “Evening Bryan, you’re fired. You make my life miserable. I can’t sleep. I’m 60 lbs overweight and I feel awful all the time.”

Giving that version of me a name and then writing down his persuasive tactics such as “tonight is the last night” or “tomorrow we’ll work extra hard to burn off the calories” gave me the tools I needed to stand my ground. Evening Bryan’s authority to eat between 5 pm and 10 pm was revoked. No matter what, Evening Bryan cannot eat food because if given the chance, he’ll eat too much and ruin life for Sleep Bryan, Morning Bryan, Work Bryan and Dad Bryan. 

We all have bad habits. Things we do that we don’t really want to do. They never actually make us happy. They in fact make us sad and regretful.

Here’s one approach to move past your bad habits:

Identify a version of you that is responsible for self destructive behavior and give them a name (i.e. Evening Bryan).
Write down the persuasion techniques they use to get what they want (“today’s the last day”). 
Prepare a list of rebuttals that enables you to stand your ground (“this is not what we really want”, “we know this makes us sad and regretful”). 
Identify which versions of you should be in charge (i.e. Morning you) and give them the authority to make decisions on behalf of your Evening Bryan.
